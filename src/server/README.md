# Skype Server

The server leverages an `PassiveConn` and `ConnectionPoll` to `listen`, `accept` and `receive`, `respond` to multiple client connections. 
Because server has a mere supporting role proving basic user information accross the wire, read and write operations will be sparse and the amount
of data transfered small. For that reason, the server was implemented to run on a single thread to avoid an 
overly complicated design unnecessarily.

The maximum number of connected clients managed by the `ConnectionPoll` may be increased using the `MAX_CONNECTIONS`
macro in `include/shared/connection/connection_poll.hpp`.


## Server Setup

On a ubutu box ensure you have all postgres dev libraries install

        sudo apt-get install libpq-dev postgresql-server-dev-all

It might be necessary to add you postgres version (`psql --verion`) to `libpqxx` CMakeLists.txt in `src/server/vendor/libpqxx/CMakeLists.txt`. 
For postgres v12.11 for example.

           set(PostgreSQL_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "12" "12.11") 

## Request

The server uses a `Request` object to pass around information. An `ActiveConn::accept` will create a `Request`
and which will be used to send back a `200 OK` response to the connected client.

           accept  -> | request |  -> respond(request) -> OK 200

After the connection is established the server will loop in `Server::main_loop` listen to messages from all connected clients or
for new connection requests from other clients.

When a message is detected `ActiveConn::receive` will populate the request with the client information such as 
`Request.m_address`, `Request.m_socket` etc and pass that to the `Router`.


          request -> receive(populates info) ->  route -> respond


## Router and Controllers  

The router is responsible for parsing the command and arguments from the client message and route it to the
relevant `Controller`.  So a message like so

            LOGIN khalil 1234

will be routed as follows

            Controllers::login("Khalil 1234", Request req);

The controller in question will add a `Reply` to `Request.data()` depending on the result of the operation.

           // Login was succesfull then
            Request.set_data(new TextData(Reply::get_message(Reply::r_200)));

The `Request`is then passed to `ActiveConn::respond` to respond to the client.


## Database

The server persists user data user [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). Please visit the [postgres directory
for more information on how to install Postgres locally as well as examples of queries the server using in the implementation.](https://github.com/khalilmasri/Skype/tree/main/postgres)

## Command token

Apart from `LOGIN` and `CREATE`, All commands **must provide** a token back to the server. Clients
can acquire a token by sending a `LOGIN` command to the server.
      
e.g 

    LOGIN John 1234
    201  Df345rdfdsFgdETfdDFG

without arguments

    LIST Df345rdfdsFgdETfdDFG
    201 ...

with arguments

    PENDING Df345rdfdsFgdETfdDFG 4
    201 ...

## User Commands 

If a command is not valid the server will return `501 Invalid command`.

## Chat commands

### `SEND`

Sends a chat messages to a contact.  The first argument is the `recipient_id`  and second argument the message.

    200 OK
    303 Recipient not found
    502 Empty Argument

eg

    SEND 4 Hello world!
    200 OK


    SEND 99 Hello world!
    303 Recipient not found


### `PENDING`

Get pending chat messages from the current user. Client may pass in an **optional** argument specifying a `sender_id` to retrieve pending messages from a specific contact.

    PENDING 
    PENDING <contact_id> 

    201 <data>
    301 User not found
    304 Sender not found


e.g. All pending messages for the current user

    PENDING
    201 0,50,104,147:22:2,2022-08-26,2,1,falseGreat, thanks for asking!22:4,2022-08-27,4,1,falseanother message for you love.22:5,2022-08-27,4,1,falsenothing like chats

Pending messages for the current user from a specific sender id.
           
    PENDING 4
    201 0,54,97:22:4,2022-08-27,4,1,falseanother message for you love.22:5,2022-08-27,4,1,falsenothing like chats

Bad `sender_id` request

    PENDING 3293
    304 Sender not found

We have no control over what the user will input as chat message so we cannot relly delimiter to split the text content sent from the server.
Therefore, `PENDING` responses will contain a header specifying the postion to split each chat message. The response header has a `:` delimiter.

    0,54,97 -> first chat start at position 0, second chat start position 54, end of message at position 97.

Spliting chats

    201 0,54,97:22:4,2022-08-27,4,1,falseanother message for you love.22:5,2022-08-27,4,1,falsenothing like chats
                ^ 0 here                                              ^ 54 here                                  ^ 97 here

Each chat response has its own header specifying where to split between the chat metadata and content because again, there is no way to use a delimiter for user inputed content.

    header   delim     metadata                         content
    22         :       4,2022-08-27,4,1,false           another message for you love.

According to the example above we will split at position 22.

    22:4,2022-08-27,4,1,falseanother message for you love.
                             ^ here


As for the chat metadata, fields are delimited by a `,` and are the following

    id      created_at       sender_id     recipient_id      delivered                     
    4       2022-08-27       4             1                 false                        


### `CHAT`

    CHAT 
    CHAT <contact_id> 

    201 <data>
    301 User not found
    304 Sender not found


Chat retrieves all chat messages from the current users. It follows the same convention as `PENDING` as in you can specify a `sender_id` or not.

All chats

    CHAT
    201 0,50,104,147:22:2,2022-08-26,2,1,falseGreat, thanks for asking!22:4,2022-08-27,4,1,falseanother message for you love.22:5,2022-08-27,4,1,falsenothing like chats

Chat from a specific sender

    CHAT 2
    201 0,50:22:2,2022-08-26,2,1,falseGreat, thanks for asking!


Bad sender id

    CHAT 9390
    304 Sender not found
   

### `DELIVERED`

Informs the server which chats has been received/delivered so I can update the state of a chat message to `delivered = TRUE`.
Accepts a list of chat ids delimited by a `,`.
 
     DELIVERED <id1,id2,id3>

     200 OK
     305 Invalid chat <id>
     502 Empty argument

eg

     DELIVERED 1,2,3
     200 OK

All ids in the list must be correct otherwise none will be updated.

     DELIVERED 1,2,2039
     305 Invalid chat id 2039


`DELIVERED` must contain an argument

     DELIVERED 
     502 Empty argument
