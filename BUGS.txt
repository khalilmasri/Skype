[PRIORITY] cannot have > 2 concurrent users logged into the server

[1] Shouldnt be able to call offline contacts 
(this will prevent many other current bugs having to be dealt with) ====> FIXED

[2] Caller needs to be able to hangup after requesting a call before connection even happens, 
because currently it just keeps pinging and pinging until the timeout happens,
then it calls hangup twice and crashes. ====> FIXED

[3] If you are a new user with no contacts you cannot initialise the program fully
(currently: if i changed code so you can get into the central gui now and can add contacts 
but clicking on them will not bring up their chat window. but if add someone and then log out and rerun 
the program it then works, because it can initialise everything properly. i couldnt figure out how to
initialise the chats in that scenario) ====> FIXED

[4] when a one peer hangs up it sends a message to the other peer which also shuts down the his 
connection (and audio stream). That is working But the UI doesnâ€™t know that so the call floating 
window stays even when after the connection is closed. ====> FIXED

[5] The UI need to send a message over Job to Call so Call knows when to start a video connection or not. 
Or, we can just not give the user the option not to have a video conn!
